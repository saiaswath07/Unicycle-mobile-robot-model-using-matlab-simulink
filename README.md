 # Unicycle-mobile-robot-model-using-matlab-simulink

Welcome to the Unicycle Mobile Robot Model project! This repository contains a MATLAB Simulink model of a unicycle mobile robot, which is widely used in robotics research and education.

## Overview

This project aims to simulate the behavior of a unicycle mobile robot using MATLAB Simulink. The model provides insights into the kinematics and control of such robots, which can be extended for further research and practical applications.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2020a or later
- Simulink toolbox

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NandieswarPelleti/Unicycle-mobile-robot-model-using-matlab-simulink.git
    cd Unicycle-mobile-robot-model-using-matlab-simulink
    ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Simulate the Model:**
    - Open the Simulink model and click on the "Run" button to start the simulation.
    - Observe the robot's trajectory in the visualization window.

2. **Modify Parameters:**
    - You can modify the parameters of the model (e.g., initial position, control gains) directly in the Simulink model to see how they affect the robot's behavior.
